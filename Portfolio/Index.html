      <p> Add some information about yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: The Solar System</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of randomness,sounds and 3D shapes/objects. I created a 3D render of
	the solar system where there is details on each planet which varys from the size
	and the colour aswell as rotation speeds. The planets posisions are distanced by 
	varying numbers and pixels on the screen to portray the impression of a real 
	solar system model. The stars in space were all randomly generated and placed in
	a random pixel. these were done by usuing the random method/function to place "points" 
	in location inside the 3D box.
